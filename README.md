Hare
====

I'VE BEEN RENAMED!
----

Since Hare was already taken as a gem name, I've renamed the project to [Kanina](//github.com/judy/kanina). This repository will stay alive for anyone using the old gem name. 

But if you're looking for a RabbitMQ solution, or need to upgrade Hare for new features, I strongly recommend switching over to Kanina. Consider this project out-of-date and unsupported.
